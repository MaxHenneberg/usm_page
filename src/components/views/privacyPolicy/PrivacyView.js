            <h4>Anonymity</h4>
            <p>One of the unique features of the Listening Services provided by LineHayat is its emphasis on anonymity.
                Both Listening
                Volunteers and Sharers will remain anonymous at all times. Therefore, our helpline is designed in such a
                way that our
                volunteers will not be able to track the caller’s phone number, identity or any other personal
                information.</p>
            <h4>Confidentiality</h4>
            <p>At LineHayat, confidential ity is our utmost priority. Under no circumstance will our volunteers disclose
                your information or
                the content of your sharing with any third parties. Your designated Listening Volunteer will delete all
                text conversations
                between the users and LineHayat immediately after the interaction ends. No data will be stored or kept
                regardless if they
                were communicated to us through cal ls or messages.</p>
            <h4>Changes to this Privacy Statement</h4>
            <p>We might revise this privacy pol icy if needed. An official announcement will be made through our website
                at least one (1)
                month before its enforcement, which will also be broadcasted across our social media platforms. If you
                have queries,
                kindly e-mail us at linehayat@usm.my. We will get back to you within 3 days.</p>

            <h4>Risks of using LineHayat</h4>
            <p>Our users should be aware of certain personal risks of using our services, including but not l imited to
                you accidental ly
                disclosing your personal information such as your institution, identity or those of the people involved
                in your issue, your
                location, etc. However, we at LineHayat stand by our principles of anonymity and confidential ity. Your
                information remains
                safe with us and will not be shared with others.</p>
            <p>
                Some Sharers might also experience distress during their sharing, especial ly if the issues concerned
                are heavy or
                triggering for them. If this happens to you, please let our volunteers know so that we can try to help
                you overcome it to
                the best of our abilities. We would also wish to remind our users that you are free to end the
                conversation at any point
                during the communication if you feel it is necessary.</p>
            <p>
                During peak hours, our helpline might be frequently engaged due to high rates of call traffic. In this
                case, we might not be
                able to pick up every call . We hope you don’t get discouraged and are most welcomed to refer to our
                list of other similar resources for help.</p>
